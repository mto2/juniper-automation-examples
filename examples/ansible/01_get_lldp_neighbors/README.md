# NETCONF EXAMPLE: GET LLDP NEIGHBORS

This example will show how to use Ansible to perform a remote procedure call (RPC) to Juniper's NETCONF API. We will be requesting the LLDP neighbor information, storing the output as an object called `output_lldp_neighbors`, and we'll wrap up by printing the object's "parsed_output" dictionary to the terminal
